"Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been influenced "
"by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the land use areas "
"look alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at the map, the "
"viewers don't know anything about the roads they are seeing; only that there"
" is a road of a certain shape in a certain area."

"But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on "
"the map also have attributes. Maps in a GIS aren't just pictures. They "
"represent not only objects in locations, but also information about those "
"objects."

"You now know how to use the attribute table to see what is actually in the "
"data you're using. Any dataset will only be useful to you if it has the "

"can quickly decide if you're able to use a given dataset, or if you need to "
"look for another one that has the required attribute data."
