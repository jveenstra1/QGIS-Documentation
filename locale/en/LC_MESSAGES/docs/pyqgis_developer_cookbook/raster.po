"A raster layer consists of one or more raster bands --- referred to as "
"single band and multi band rasters. One band represents a matrix of "
"values. A color image (e.g. aerial photo) is a raster consisting of red, "
"blue and green bands. Single band rasters typically represent either "
"continuous variables (e.g. elevation) or discrete variables (e.g. land "
"use). In some cases, a raster layer comes with a palette and the raster "
