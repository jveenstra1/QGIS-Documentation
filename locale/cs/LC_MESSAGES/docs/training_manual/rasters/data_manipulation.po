"Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete "
"features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines "
"and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like any image. Although it may "
"portray various properties of objects in the real world, these objects don't"
" exist as separate objects; rather, they are represented using pixels of "
"various different color values."

"Luckily, QGIS allows you to do exactly this, and without needing to actually"
" create a new raster file, which could take up a lot of space. Instead, you "
"can create a **Virtual Raster**. This is also often called a *Catalog*, "

"The above methods allow you to virtually merge datasets using a catalog, and"
