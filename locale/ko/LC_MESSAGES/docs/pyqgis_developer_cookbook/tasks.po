"A task (:class:`QgsTask <qgis.core.QgsTask>`) is a container for the code to"
" be performed in the background, and the task manager "
"(:class:`QgsTaskManager <qgis.core.QgsTaskManager>`) is used to control the "
"running of the tasks. These classes simplify background processing in QGIS "
"by providing mechanisms for signaling, progress reporting and access to the "
"status for background processes. Tasks can be grouped using subtasks."

"The global task manager (found with :meth:`QgsApplication.taskManager() "

"Dependencies between tasks can be described using the :meth:`addSubTask "

"<qgis.core.QgsTask>`. When a dependency is stated, the task manager will "
"automatically determine how these dependencies will be executed. Wherever "
"possible dependencies will be executed in parallel in order to satisfy them "
"as quickly as possible. If a task on which another task depends is canceled,"
" the dependent task will also be canceled. Circular dependencies can make "
"deadlocks possible, so be careful."

"task priority, which is set in :meth:`addTask "
