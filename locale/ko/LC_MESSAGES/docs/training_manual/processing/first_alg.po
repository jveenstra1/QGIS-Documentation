"In this lesson we will run our first algorithm, and get our first result "
"from it."
msgstr "이 강의에서 첫 번째 알고리듬을 실행하고, 첫 번째 결과를 얻을 것입니다."

"As we have already mentioned, the processing framework can run algorithms "
"from other applications, but it also contains native algorithms that need no"
" external software to be run. To start exploring the processing framework, "
"we are going to run one of those native algorithms. In particular, we are "
"going to calculate the centroids of set of polygons."
msgstr ""
"앞에서 언급했듯이, 공간처리 프레임워크는 다른 응용 프로그램에서 알고리듬을 실행할 수도 있지만, 외부 소프트웨어 없이 실행할 수 있는 "
"자체 알고리듬을 내장하고 있기도 합니다. 공간처리 프레임워크에 대해 알아보기 위해 이 자체 알고리듬 가운데 하나를 실행해보겠습니다. 먼저"
" 폴리곤 집합의 중심점을 계산해봅시다."

"First, open the QGIS project corresponding to this lesson. It contains just "
"a single layer with two polygons"

"Now go to the text box at the top of the toolbox. That is the search box, "
"and if you type text in it, it will filter the list of algorithms so just "
"those ones containing the entered text are shown. If there are algorithms "
"that match your search but belong to a provider that is not active, an "
"additional label will be shown in the lower part of the toolbox."

"The search box is a very practical way of finding the algorithm you are "
"looking for. At the bottom of the dialog, an additional label shows that "
"there are algorithms that match your search but belong to a provider that is"
" not active. If you click on the link in that label, the list of algorithms "
"will also include results from those inactive providers, which will be shown"
" in light gray. A link to activate each inactive provider is also shown. "
"We'll see later how to activate other providers."

"To execute an algorithm, you just have to double-click on its name in the "
"toolbox. When you double-click on the *Polygon centroids* algorithm, you "
"will see the following dialog."

"All algorithms have a similar interface, which basically contains input "
"parameters that you have to fill, and outputs that you have to select where "
"to store. In this case, the only input we have is a vector layer with "
"polygons."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_alg.rst:49
msgid ""
"Select the *Polygons* layer as input. The algorithm has a single output, "
"which is the centroids layer. There are two options to define where a data "
"output is saved: enter a filepath or save it to a temporary filename"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_alg.rst:53
msgid ""
"In case you want to set a destination and not save the result in a temporary"
" file, the format of the output is defined by the filename extension. To "
"select a format, just select the corresponding file extension (or add it if "
"you are directly typing the filepath instead). If the extension of the "
"filepath you entered does not match any of the supported ones, a default "
"extension (usually :file:`.dbf` for tables, :file:`.tif` for raster layers "
"and :file:`.shp` for vector ones) will be appended to the filepath and the "
"file format corresponding to that extension will be used to save the layer "
"or table."

"In all the exercises in this guide, we will be saving results to a temporary"
" file, since there is no need to save them for a later use. Feel free to "
"save them to a permanent location if you want to."

msgid ""
"Temporary files are deleted once you close QGIS. If you create a project "
"with an output that was saved as a temporary output, QGIS will complain when"
" you try to open back the project later, since that output file will not "
"exist."

"The output has the same CRS as the input. Geoalgorithms assumes all input "
"layers share the same CRS and do not perform any reprojection. Except in the"
" case of some special algorithms (for instance, reprojection ones), the "
"outputs will also have that same CRS. We will see more about this soon."
msgstr ""
"출력물은 입력물과 동일한 CRS를 사용합니다. 공간 알고리듬은 모든 입력 레이어가 동일한 CRS를 공유한다고 가정하며 어떤 재투영 작업도"
" 하지 않습니다. 몇몇 특별한 알고리듬(예를 들면 재투영 알고리듬)을 제외하면, 출력물도 동일한 CRS를 사용합니다. 곧 이에 대해 더 "
"자세히 다루게 될 것입니다."

"Try yourself saving it using different file formats (use, for instance, "
":file:`shp` and :file:`geojson` as extensions). Also, if you do not want the"
" layer to be loaded in QGIS after it is generated, you can check off the "
"checkbox that is found below the output path box."
