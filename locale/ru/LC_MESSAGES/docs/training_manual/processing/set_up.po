"The first thing to do before using the processing framework is to configure "
"it. There is not much to set-up, so this is an easy task."

"Later on we will show how to configure the external applications that are "
"used for extending the list of available algorithms, but for now we are just"
" going to work with the framework itself."

"The processing framework is a core QGIS plugin, which means that it should "
"already be installed in your system, since it is included with QGIS. In case"
" it is active, you should see a menu called :guilabel:`Processing` in your "
"menu bar. There you can access all the framework components."

"If you cannot find that menu, you have to enable the plugin by going to the "
"plugin manager and activating it."

"The main element that we are going to work with is the toolbox. Click on the"
" corresponding menu entry and you will see the toolbox docked at the right "
"side of the QGIS window."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:30
msgid ""
"The toolbox contains a list of all the available algorithms, divided in "
"groups called *Providers*. Providers can be (de)activated in the "
":menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Processing`. We will discuss that "
"dialog later in this manual."

"By default, only providers that do not rely on third-party applications "
"(that is, those that only require QGIS elements to be run) are active. "
"Algorithms requiring external applications might need additional "
"configuration. Configuring providers is explained in a later chapter in this"
" manual."

"If you have reached this point, now you are ready to use geoalgorithms. "
"There is no need to configure anything else by now. We can already run our "
"first algorithm, which we will do in the next lesson."
