"We already know how to use the raster calculator to create new raster layers"
" using mathematical expressions. A similar algorithm is available for vector"
" layers, and generates a new layer with the same attributes of the input "
"layer, plus an additional one with the result of the expression entered. The"
" algorithm is called *Field calculator* and has the following parameters "
"dialog."

"First, let's calculate the population density of white people in each "
"polygon, which represents a census. We have two fields in the attributes "
"table that we can use for that, namely ``WHITE`` and ``SHAPE_AREA``. We just"
" have to divide them and multiply by one million (to have density per square"
" km), so we can use the following formula in the corresponding field"
