"While PostGIS is generally used on a server to provide spatial database "
"capabilities to multiple users at the same time, QGIS also supports the use "
"of a file format called *spatialite* that is a lightweight, portable way to "
"store an entire spatial database in a single file. Obviously, these 2 types "
"of spatial databases should be used for different purposes, but the same "
"basic principles and techniques apply to both. Let's create a new spatialite"
" database and explore the functionality provided to work with these "
"databases in QGIS."
